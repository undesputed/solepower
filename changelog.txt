Global steps performed (all pages)
- Added a top-of-file developer notes + QA report comment block (includes canonical placeholder and missing assets/assumptions).
- Ensured HTML5 shell + language declaration (set to lang="en").
- Added/standardized SEO metadata: title, meta description, robots, canonical.
- Added/updated Open Graph + Twitter card metadata with placeholder og-default image path.
- Added a skip-to-content link and focus-visible outline styling.
- Improved primary navigation accessibility (aria-label on <nav>).
- Hardened footer toggle scripts (null checks, keyboard support for Enter/Space).
- Added rel="noopener noreferrer" to target="_blank" outbound footer links.

/index.html
- Converted main wrapper to semantic <main id="content"> landmark.
- Added accessible table region labeling for the main comparison table wrapper.
- Updated OG type to "article".

/about.html
- Converted main wrapper to semantic <main id="content"> landmark and ensured footer sits outside main.
- Added JSON-LD WebPage schema for the About page (kept existing JSON-LD that appears homepage-oriented; flagged for manual review).

/contact.html
- Converted main wrapper to semantic <main id="content"> landmark and ensured footer sits outside main.
- Fixed form accessibility: added unique input ids, associated <label for>, added aria-describedby and an aria-live status region placeholder.
- Added JSON-LD WebPage schema for the Contact page (kept existing JSON-LD that appears homepage-oriented; flagged for manual review).

Notes
- Canonical/OG/Twitter URLs are placeholders (https://example.com/...). Replace with the production base URL during deployment.
- Add /og-default.jpg (recommended 1200×630) to match the placeholder image URL used in metadata.


## Update: SEO + responsiveness polish (www canonical)
Date: 2025-12-12

Files updated:
- /index.html
- /about.html
- /contact.html
- /robots.txt
- /sitemap.xml
- /.htaccess

SEO / crawl:
- Switched canonical + Open Graph + Twitter meta URLs to use https://www.solepowertech.com/... across all pages.
- Updated JSON-LD structured data URLs/ids to match the www domain for consistency.
- Updated robots sitemap directive to https://www.solepowertech.com/sitemap.xml.
- Updated sitemap.xml <loc> entries to https://www.solepowertech.com/... and removed double-slash URLs.

Structured data (JSON-LD):
- Home (index): kept Article/FAQ/Organization/Breadcrumb, but normalized ids/urls and fixed image/logo fields to real site assets.
- About: replaced homepage-oriented JSON-LD with WebSite + Organization + BreadcrumbList + AboutPage.
- Contact: replaced homepage-oriented JSON-LD with WebSite + Organization (with ContactPoint) + BreadcrumbList + ContactPage.

Mobile responsiveness / layout:
- Centered page content reliably by centering the <main> element (margin-left/right: auto).
- Removed percentage body side-margins that caused drift at some breakpoints; set body margin/padding to 0.
- Added global box-sizing: border-box to reduce overflow/layout issues on responsive widths.
- Improved table behavior on small screens by enabling horizontal scrolling on the casino table wrapper (overflow-x: auto).
- Ensured mobile container width stays consistent at <=480px (width: 100% !important).

Accessibility / semantic HTML:
- Converted footer toggle from a <div> to a real <button> and added aria-controls/aria-expanded; updated JS accordingly.
- Improved logo alt text (more descriptive).

Notes:
- When viewing locally via file://, canonical/meta URLs will still point to production (this is expected for SEO).
